<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This repository documents development processes and hosts the tools used by the OASIS Virtual I/O Device (VIRTIO) Technical Committee.  See also the resources in the <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-spec">virtio-spec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-docs">virtio-docs</a> TC GitHub repositories</p>

<p>VIRTIO describes describes the specifications of the "virtio" family of devices. These devices are found in virtual environments, yet by design they look like physical devices to the guest within the virtual machine &mdash; and this document treats them as such. This similarity allows the guest to use standard drivers and discovery mechanisms.</p>

<p>The purpose of VIRTIO and this specification is that virtual environments and guests should have a straightforward, efficient, standard and extensible mechanism for virtual devices, rather than boutique per-environment or per-OS mechanisms.</p>

<h3>Further Description of this Repository</h3>
<strong>Clarification of OASIS TC process as applied to the Virtio TC:</strong>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Virtio TC Meetings:</strong></dt>
<dd>The Virtio TC has adopted a standing rule to conduct business only by electronic ballot, without Meetings.
The list of all current and past ballots can be found on
<A HREF="https://groups.oasis-open.org/higherlogic/ws/public/ballots?wg_id=b3f5efa5-0e12-4320-873b-018dc7d3f25c">this page</A>.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Gaining voting rights</strong></dt>
<dd>A TC Member who lacks voting rights shall only gain voting rights
   after requesting this from the TC chair by submitting the request to the
   <a href="https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/community-home/digestviewer?CommunityKey=b3f5efa5-0e12-4320-873b-018dc7d3f25c">OASIS-virtio@connectedcommunity.org mailing list</a>
   with a copy sent to the TC chairs by email. For example, for a new TC member
   to gain voting rights the request shall be sent to the TC
   chairs after the close of the 60th day.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Maintaining Voting Rights</strong></dt>
<dd>
A Voting Member who fails to cast a ballot in two consecutive Work Product
Ballots for which the voting periods do not overlap loses the voting rights at
the close of the second ballot missed. In case of multiple ballots taking place
simultaneously, voting in a single ballot is sufficient to maintain voting
rights.
<br>Note: to avoid losing voting rights due to an extended absence,
A Voting Member can request a leave of absence.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Leave of Absence</strong></dt>
<dd>
To avoid losing voting rights due to an extended absence,
Every Voting Member can request a leave of absence.
A Leave of
Absence shall not exceed 45 days. Each request shall be made by sending an
email to the TC mailing list at least 7 days before the Leave is to start.
<br>The TC has resolved that all such requests are automatically approved.
</dd>
